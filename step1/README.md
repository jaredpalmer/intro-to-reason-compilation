# 1 - Compile and Run a Single Reason File

OCaml's compiler has a nice, flexible pre-processing step described in [`run.sh`](https://github.com/chenglou/intro-to-reason-compilation/blob/master/step1/run.sh). A Reason file is just an ordinary OCaml file that leverages that feature. Therefore, everything that semantically works in OCaml should, in theory, work in Reason, and vice-versa.

We start with a shell file, [`run.sh`](https://github.com/chenglou/intro-to-reason-compilation/blob/master/step1/run.sh), which, upon execution, compiles & runs the output. See also the [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/chenglou/intro-to-reason-compilation/blob/master/step1/.gitignore).
